        Typography styles should be composed of a combination of functional
        modifier classes, base element styles, and block classes. Many of the 
        things we wan to do with typography can be shared across different 
        types of tags. For instance #[span(class="inline-code") .up] and 
        #[span(class="inline-code") .nml] or 
        #[span(class="inline-code") .hvy] can be applied to headings, 
        paragraphs, and other elements. It's best to use these in
        conjunction with a base element style rather than to build a
        completely custom class with duplicate style declarations. This also
        makes specific elements more flexible on a per-page basis.

        The primary fonts for this application are #[span(class="inline-code") Roboto]
        and #[span(class="inline-code") Roboto Condensed]. Do not import other
        fonts into this project unless they are part of an intentional design.
        Additionally, use only predefined variables to declare a font.
