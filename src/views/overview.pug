        This styleguide is the definitive source of knowledge about our
        user interface implementation. It is a living user interface element
        reference that can also act as a playground for alterations and
        new components.

        The styleguide should be maintained and updated alongside the
        components and styles that live within the application. If an update
        is made in the main application, then this guide must be updated
        here and visa versa.
